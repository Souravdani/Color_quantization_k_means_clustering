# Color_quantization_k_means_clustering
Color quantization of a palm tree image (aesthetics enhancing) with the help of k means clustering.
Quantizing colors means we willll reduce the number of unique colors here to K unique colors. We are trying 6 colors.
We proceeded with Converting .JPG/ .PNG etc into a numpy array as we will be running the k means clusturing on an numpy array data.
Then we have reduced the dimension of the array from 3D to 2D and then our clustering on it.
We have changed the dimenssion back to 3D after clustering.
finally our quantized image is ready.
